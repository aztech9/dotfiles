# dotfiles
a collection of nice aliases and dotfiles I have chosen to share with the internet. No private methods allowed sorry n00bs >_<

just source aliases_public.sh and merge whatever you want in the configs. this repo was not meant to be used as a template for your setup, anon!!!!

what you can do:
* learn from my bash mistakes and make better scripts
* get some pussy by telling ladies you have aliases_private.sh
* port it to zsh
* draw a painting of a sailboat
* chat with cats

thanks to the following people for helping with the scripts:
* snowfag for improving pw()
