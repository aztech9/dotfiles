# dotfiles
a collection of nice aliases and dotfiles I have chosen to share with the internet. No private methods allowed sorry n00bs >_<

what you can do:
* learn from my bash mistakes and make better scripts
* get some pussy by telling ladies you have aliases_private.sh
* port it to zsh
* draw a painting of a sailboat
* chat with cats

thanks to the following people for helping with the scripts:
* snowfag for improving pw()
